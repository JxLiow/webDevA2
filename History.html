                            2,500 years ago, people were racing with boats, <br>
                            <br>
                            in hopes of appeasing the rain god for rain.

                    Dragon boat racing began more than 2000 years ago, where it was done as a ritual to bring good harvest to the people<br>
                    <br>
                    The races were held at life-sustaining rivers in the valleys of southern China. <br>

                    Qu Yuan, a great warrior and poet, in midst of a protest against the corrupted government,<br>
                    threw himself in the river Mi Lo on the day of the festival. <br>

                            During this period, Cat fishes were perceived as <i>Dragons</i> due to their large size. <br>

                            So in order to prevent the "Dragons" from eating Qu Yuan's body, <br>
                            they threw Zongzi into the river so as to lure them away from the corpse.

                    The locals were very fond of Qu Yuan during then. So they raced out in order to rescue him.<br>
                    <br>
                    They beat on drums and splashed their oars in water in an attempt to keep the dragons away, <br>
                    who were the inhabitants of the rivers.
